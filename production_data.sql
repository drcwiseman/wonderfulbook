He designed a system, both ancient and prophetic, where Heaven responds to earth through the power of an altar.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>home altar</strong>&nbsp;is not just a piece of furniture or a sacred corner‚Äîit‚Äôs a spiritual technology. A divine access point. A place where your sacrifices speak louder than your enemies‚Äô accusations. A prophetic gate where heaven meets your household and where fire is kindled daily to protect, direct, and empower you.</p><p>In church, there is a central altar where corporate power is released. But what happens when the warfare follows you home? When you feel spiritually attacked in the night? When your children are under siege? When something unseen is choking your progress‚Äîyet you‚Äôve been praying, fasting, tithing, and nothing seems to shift?</p><p>That‚Äôs where the home altar comes in.</p><p>This book is a 28-chapter prophetic and practical journey to teach you:</p><ul><li><p><strong>How to build, dedicate, and protect your personal home altar</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How to connect your home altar to your church altar for multiplied effect</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How to activate divine protocols using oil, water, communion, prayer, and sacrifice</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How to guard your altar from defilement and strange fire</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How to release prophetic fire that speaks louder than any curse, witchcraft, or legal accusation</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How to raise family altars that cover your children, restore marriages, and secure legacy</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>And ultimately, how to become a walking altar yourself‚Äîcarrying divine presence and power wherever you go</strong></p></li></ul><p>This is not just about setting up a sacred place‚Äîit‚Äôs about unlocking divine patterns and supernatural systems that govern victories, covenant, restoration, and legacy.</p><p>Throughout these 28 chapters, you‚Äôll also discover:</p><p>‚úÖ Hidden biblical secrets from Abraham, Elijah, David, and Jesus<br>‚úÖ Real-life testimonies of breakthrough and deliverance from believers around the world<br>‚úÖ Prophetic activations to anoint your home, break generational cycles, and recover stolen blessings<br>‚úÖ Step-by-step guides for cleansing, rededication, and aligning your altar with God‚Äôs timing</p><hr><h3><strong>Who Is This Book For?</strong></h3><p>This book is for the spiritual warrior who is tired of recycled battles.<br>It‚Äôs for the prayerful mother who wants to secure her children‚Äôs destiny.<br>It‚Äôs for the business owner who senses invisible resistance.<br>It‚Äôs for the prophetic intercessor, the pastor, the home leader, the frustrated believer who feels like something spiritual is ‚Äúoff‚Äù‚Äîand is finally ready to fix it.</p><hr><h3><strong>A Word from the Author</strong></h3><p>For over two decades, I‚Äôve seen firsthand how altars rule outcomes.<br>Some people‚Äôs lives are blocked because of evil altars in their bloodline. Others struggle because their altar at home is silent, defiled, or never existed. But when the right altar is raised and honored properly‚Äîmiracles happen. I‚Äôve seen barrenness end, marriages restored, finances explode, curses reversed, and demons silenced.</p><p>In&nbsp;<em>How to Build a Powerful Home Altar</em>, I‚Äôll walk you step-by-step through this sacred yet practical process. Whether you‚Äôre new to this or deeply seasoned, this book will equip you to experience God‚Äôs presence, power, and prophetic guidance like never before.</p><p>Are you ready to build an altar that speaks louder than any attack?</p><p>Then let‚Äôs begin.</p><p>‚Äî<br><strong>Dr. Climate Wiseman</strong></p>	/uploads/1754454759109-pm9ru.png	/uploads/pdfs/1754454747556-ejj37p.pdf	5.00	0	f	free	2025-08-06 04:33:41.757605	2025-08-06 04:33:41.757605	Discover powerful insights and practical strategies that will transform your personal and professional life.
