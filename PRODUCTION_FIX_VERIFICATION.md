# Production PDF Fix Verification Report

## Status Check
Date: $(date)

### What Was Done:
- SQL commands from CRITICAL_PDF_FIX.sql were executed on production database
- This should have updated all books with 175504xxx PDFs to use correct existing PDFs

### Expected Results:
- All "30 Days to Overcome" books should now have working PDFs
- PDF URLs should no longer contain "175504" in the filename
- Books should load with correct content matching their titles

### How to Verify:
1. Go to https://mywonderfulbooks.com
2. Click on any "30 Days to Overcome" book
3. Click "Start Reading" 
4. The PDF should load correctly with content matching the book title

### If Still Not Working:
The SQL may not have run correctly. Try:
1. Running the SQL again with explicit database selection
2. Or manually update books through the admin panel at /admin
3. Or re-upload the PDFs for affected books
