# Digital Book Streaming Platform

## Project Overview
A comprehensive digital book streaming platform with advanced administrative tools for email system configuration and management. The platform features React with TypeScript frontend, Express.js backend with robust email systems, and comprehensive admin panels.

## Core Technologies
- Frontend: React with TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- Backend: Express.js with TypeScript, Drizzle ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL  
- Email: Nodemailer with SMTP configuration
- Payments: Stripe integration
- Authentication: Express sessions with Passport.js
- File Storage: Object storage with local fallback

## Recent Changes

### Cloud Run Deployment Fixes (Aug 11, 2025)
Applied comprehensive fixes for Cloud Run deployment failures:

**âœ… Server Configuration:**
- Fixed server.listen() to use standard Node.js syntax for Cloud Run compatibility
- Server binds to `0.0.0.0:${PORT}` with proper Cloud Run environment support
- Added environment variable validation for required secrets
- Production environment detection with proxy trust and graceful shutdown

**âœ… Health Check Endpoints (No Database Dependencies):**
- `/health` - Immediate deployment readiness check with uptime metrics
- `/ping` - Simple load balancer health check (returns "pong")  
- `/healthz` - Kubernetes/Cloud Run liveness probe
- All endpoints respond instantly without database queries during initialization
- Added Cache-Control headers to prevent health check caching

**âœ… Startup Optimization for Cloud Run:**
- Heavy initialization (crypto, email, health monitoring) deferred in production
- Server starts listening FIRST before background service initialization
- 2-second delay for background services to allow Cloud Run traffic readiness
- Clear "READY FOR TRAFFIC" signal for Cloud Run deployment detection

**âœ… TypeScript & Build Fixes:**
- Resolved all LSP diagnostics and TypeScript import errors
- Fixed multer callback signature and storage method calls
- Added proper type annotations for express-session and connect-pg-simple
- Build process optimized for production deployment

**âœ… Cloud Run Compatibility:**
- Added deployment health check script (deploy-health-check.js)
- Production logging optimized for Cloud Run log aggregation
- Startup performance improvements for faster deployment initialization

### Architecture
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ client/          # React frontend with TypeScript
â”œâ”€â”€ server/          # Express.js backend
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes.ts    # Main API routes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ health/      # Health monitoring system
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/  # Authentication & security
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ storage.ts   # Database abstraction layer
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/          # Shared schemas and types
â””â”€â”€ views/           # EJS templates for admin dashboard
```

### Key Features
- Multi-tier subscription system (Free, Basic, Premium)
- Advanced email campaign management
- PDF book streaming and reading
- User analytics and admin dashboard
- Object storage for file management
- Comprehensive security and anti-abuse systems
- Health monitoring and scheduled tasks

### User Preferences
- Follow modern full-stack JavaScript patterns
- Prioritize frontend functionality with minimal backend
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Maintain clean, production-ready code

### Deployment Status
The application is now Cloud Run deployment-ready with all fixes applied:

**ðŸš€ Cloud Run Compatibility:**
- âœ… Server listening with Cloud Run standard syntax
- âœ… Immediate health endpoints without database dependencies
- âœ… Background service initialization deferred until after traffic readiness
- âœ… Production environment variable validation
- âœ… TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- âœ… Startup performance optimized for deployment initialization

**âš¡ Key Deployment Improvements:**
- Server starts accepting traffic within 2 seconds
- Health checks respond instantly during initialization
- Background services initialize after deployment success
- Clear deployment readiness logging for Cloud Run
- Enhanced error handling for production environments

**ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps:**
- Deploy using Replit's deployment system
- Monitor deployment logs for "READY FOR TRAFFIC" confirmation
- Validate health endpoints respond immediately
- Confirm background services initialize after deployment

Ready for successful Cloud Run deployment.
