## Recent Changes

### Production-Ready Authentication System Implemented (Aug 11, 2025)
**üîê NEW AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM COMPLETE**

Implemented a comprehensive production-ready authentication system that completely replaces the email verification/password reset flow with a simplified, secure approach:

**‚úÖ Core Features:**
- **Registration**: Collects name, email, phone number with 6+ character password requirement
- **Login**: Email/password authentication with session management
- **No Email Verification**: Users can immediately access the platform after registration
- **No Password Reset**: Support-based password assistance for enhanced security
- **Phone Collection**: Required field for user identification and support

**üõ°Ô∏è Security Features:**
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 registrations per 15 minutes, 10 logins per 15 minutes per IP
- **Captcha Integration**: Cloudflare Turnstile support (configurable with TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY/TURNSTILE_SECRET)
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds 12 (production) / 10 (development)
- **Input Validation**: Express-validator + Zod schema validation
- **Session Security**: HttpOnly cookies, secure in production, proper CORS
- **Admin Password Reset**: Token-based admin endpoint for password resets when needed

**üîß Technical Implementation:**
- **Backend Routes**: `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/me`
- **Frontend Components**: `RegisterForm.tsx`, `LoginForm.tsx` with React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Database Schema**: Added `name` and `phone` columns to users table with indexes
- **Middleware**: Production auth middleware with rate limiting and captcha verification
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with detailed validation feedback

**üì± User Experience:**
- **Immediate Access**: No email verification wait time
- **Support-Based Recovery**: Contact support for password assistance instead of automated reset
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design with dark/light mode support
- **Real-time Validation**: Client-side validation with server-side security

**üéØ Routes Available:**
- `/register` - New user registration
- `/login` - User login
- Legacy routes (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`) still available for backward compatibility

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Fully tested with curl, all endpoints working, ready for production deployment

### Cloud Run Deployment Optimizations (Aug 11, 2025)
Applied comprehensive fixes for Cloud Run deployment failures with advanced startup optimization:

**üöÄ Server Startup Sequence (Cloud Run Optimized):**
- Ultra-lightweight health endpoints respond instantly (`/health`, `/ping`, `/healthz`)
- Server starts listening FIRST before ANY heavy initialization
- Background services deferred via `setImmediate()` to prevent blocking deployment
- Minimal production logging to avoid overwhelming Cloud Run initialization
- Graceful error handling for missing environment variables

**‚ö° Background Service Initialization:**
- Parallel service initialization with `Promise.allSettled()` for faster startup
- SMTP connection verification skipped in production to prevent blocking
- Email scheduler only initializes if SMTP environment variables are present
- Health monitoring scheduler with production-optimized logging
- Crypto system initialization with enhanced error recovery

**üõ°Ô∏è Stripe Payment Integration (Cloud Run Safe):**
- Graceful handling of missing Stripe configuration during deployment
- Null checks added to all Stripe API calls to prevent startup failures
- Payment routes return appropriate 503 errors when Stripe not configured
- Webhook endpoints include Stripe availability validation

**üîß Environment & Dependencies:**
- Simplified required environment variables (only DATABASE_URL mandatory)
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY validation with fallback handling
- Production vs development mode optimization throughout codebase
- Enhanced error handling for external service dependencies

**üìä Health Monitoring (Production Ready):**
- Immediate health check responses without database dependencies
- Production logging reduced to essential error reporting only
- Health scheduler with timeout protection and error recovery
- Cloud Run compatible health probe endpoints

### Deployment Status - READY FOR REDEPLOYMENT (Aug 11, 2025)
**üöÄ DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION COMPLETE**

The current deployment at https://workspace.drcwiseman.replit.app is serving an **OLD VERSION** and broken (returns "Not Found" for email routes).

**‚úÖ All Fixes Applied and Verified:**
- Environment detection fixed: Changed from `app.get("env")` to `process.env.NODE_ENV`
- Static file serving configuration corrected for React Router
- Production build process verified working locally
- Server startup sequence optimized for Cloud Run
- Background service initialization properly deferred
- Frontend routing properly configured for `/auth/reset-password` routes
- Production index.html properly generated without development scripts

**‚úÖ Build System Verified (Aug 11, 2025):**
- Created comprehensive deployment scripts (`scripts/prepare-deploy.js`, `scripts/redeploy.js`)
- Build artifacts verified: `server/public/index.html` ‚úì, `server/dist/index.js` ‚úì
- All dependencies installed and build process working
- Development server running with all health checks passing

**üéØ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT:**
- All code fixes are complete and tested locally
- Build system produces correct artifacts
- Development environment fully functional
- **Next step: Click "Deploy" button in Replit workspace**

**Status:** ‚úÖ READY - Awaiting manual deployment trigger

## New Build & Deploy System (Aug 11, 2025)
**üöÄ COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

**Complete Build Process:**
- `npm run build` now orchestrates full production build
- Builds React frontend ‚Üí copies to `server/public/`
- Builds backend TypeScript ‚Üí `server/dist/index.js`
- `npm start` runs production server with proper environment

**React Router Support:**
- Created `server/production.ts` with history fallback support
- All non-API routes serve `index.html` for client-side routing
- Email reset (`/auth/reset-password`) and verification (`/verify-email`) routes guaranteed to work

**Production Environment Fixed:**
- Proper `NODE_ENV=production` detection and enforcement
- Static file serving with caching headers
- Build validation and error handling

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/build-production.js` - Complete build orchestration
- `scripts/start-production.js` - Production startup with validation
- `server/production.ts` - React Router compatible Express serving

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Ready for deployment with comprehensive build system

### Deployment Scripts Created (Aug 11, 2025)
**üõ†Ô∏è AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE**

**Created comprehensive deployment automation:**

**`scripts/prepare-deploy.js` (Build & Verify):**
- Installs all dependencies with `npm install`
- Builds frontend and backend with `npm run build`
- Verifies `server/public/index.html` and `server/dist/index.js` exist
- Tests current deployment endpoints (optional)
- Provides clear deployment readiness status

**`scripts/redeploy.js` (Full Automation):**
- Complete build pipeline automation
- Build artifact verification
- Git commit and push (when available)
- Post-deployment endpoint testing
- Comprehensive success/failure reporting

**Usage:**
```bash
# Prepare and verify build (recommended)
node scripts/prepare-deploy.js

# Full automated redeploy (when git available)
node scripts/redeploy.js
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Deployment preparation verified, ready for manual deployment
