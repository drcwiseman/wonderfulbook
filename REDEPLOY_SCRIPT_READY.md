# 🚀 Redeploy Script Ready

## Created: `scripts/redeploy.js`

Your comprehensive one-command redeploy script is ready! It handles the complete deployment pipeline:

### What the Script Does:

1. **🔧 Builds React Frontend**
   - Runs `npm install && npm run build` in `/client`
   - Installs dependencies and creates production build

2. **📁 Copies Frontend Files**
   - Copies `/client/dist` to `/server/public`
   - Creates directories if they don't exist
   - Removes old files first

3. **⚙️ Builds Backend TypeScript**
   - Compiles server code to `/server/dist/index.js`
   - Uses esbuild for production bundling

4. **✅ Verifies Build Artifacts**
   - Checks `server/public/index.html` exists
   - Checks `server/dist/index.js` exists
   - Exits with error if builds failed

5. **📤 Git Operations**
   - Commits all changes with timestamp
   - Pushes to deployment branch
   - Triggers Replit Deploy automatically

6. **🧪 Tests Deployment**
   - Waits 30 seconds for deployment
   - Tests `/auth/reset-password?token=test`
   - Tests `/verify-email?token=test`
   - Verifies 200 OK with HTML responses

### How to Run:

```bash
# Method 1: Direct execution
node scripts/redeploy.js

# Method 2: Add to package.json manually
# Add this line to scripts section:
# "redeploy": "node scripts/redeploy.js"
# Then run: npm run redeploy
```
