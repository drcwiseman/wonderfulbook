# Deployment Fix Summary

## CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
The deployed application at https://workspace.drcwiseman.replit.app is serving an **OLD VERSION** that doesn't include the environment fixes I've implemented.

## Root Cause
- The production deployment is stuck on an older codebase version
- The server environment detection wasn't working properly (now fixed)
- Static file serving configuration needed updates (now fixed)

## Fixes Applied
✅ **Server Environment Detection Fixed**
- Changed from `app.get("env") === "development"` to `process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"`
- Added proper environment logging for debugging
- Created production startup script with forced environment variables

✅ **Production Build Verified**
- Build process works correctly: `npm run build`
- Production static files are properly generated in `dist/public/`
- Production index.html is correct (no Vite client scripts)

✅ **Cloud Run Deployment Optimizations**
- Server starts immediately before heavy initialization
- Background services deferred with `setImmediate()`
- Health endpoints respond instantly
- Production logging minimized
- Graceful Stripe integration handling

## Test Results (Local)
✅ Development mode: Works correctly on port 5000
✅ Production build: Generates correct static files
✅ Production HTML: Clean (no Vite development scripts)
✅ API endpoints: Functional in development
✅ Static file serving: Fixed environment detection

## Deployment Required
The application needs to be **REDEPLOYED** using Replit's deployment system to apply these fixes.

**Current State:**
- Local development: ✅ Working
- Local production build: ✅ Working
- Deployed production: ❌ Broken (old version)

**Next Step:**
User must redeploy the application using Replit's deploy button to get the fixed version running at https://workspace.drcwiseman.replit.app

## Password Reset Route
Once redeployed, the `/auth/reset-password?token=...` route will work correctly because:
- Frontend routing properly configured
- Static file serving fixed
- Environment detection corrected
- Client-side routing properly handled
