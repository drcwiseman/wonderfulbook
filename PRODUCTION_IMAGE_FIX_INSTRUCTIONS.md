# PRODUCTION IMAGE FIX - Manual Solution Required

## Issue Identified âœ…
- Production database is separate from development database
- Production has different book titles than development  
- Production books reference JPG files that don't exist (all return 404)
- Original PNG files exist on server but belong to different books
- Database updates from development don't sync to production

## Solution: Admin Panel Upload ðŸ”§

Since you're logged into the admin panel at mywonderfulbooks.com, you need to manually re-upload book covers:

### Step 1: Identify Books Needing Covers
Books currently showing "Book Cover" placeholder:
1. "30 Days to Overcome the Fear of Change" (broken: 1755039541678-xwxwbp.jpg)
2. "30 Days To Overcome The Fear Of The Unknown" (broken: 1755039476096-tplnzo.jpg)  
3. "30 Days To Overcome The Lack Of Purpose" (broken: 1755039391407-ndu4f.jpg)
4. "30 Days to Overcome The Lack of Enthusiasm" (broken: 1755039335174-9ej5j.jpg)
5. "30 Days To Overcome The Fear Of Rejection" (broken: 1755039271576-8luag.jpg)

### Step 2: Admin Panel Process
For each book showing placeholder:

1. **Go to Content Library > Manage Existing Books**
2. **Find the book** with placeholder image
3. **Click Edit button** (pencil icon)
4. **Upload new cover image** using the image upload field
5. **Save changes**

This will:
- Create a new working image file on production server
- Update the production database with correct image URL
- Display actual book cover instead of placeholder

### Available Cover Images
If you have the original book covers, you can re-upload them. The system will create new working file paths automatically.

### Alternative: Quick Fix with Existing Images
If covers aren't available, you could temporarily assign the working PNG files:

- 1754454759109-pm9ru.png
- 1754454964404-hyn8.png

But this would show incorrect covers for those books.

## Why Database Updates Don't Work
- Development and production use separate databases
- Changes to development database don't affect production
- Only admin panel uploads update production database directly

## Next Steps
1. Upload correct book covers through admin panel for each placeholder book
2. Verify images display correctly on live site
3. Confirm all featured books show proper covers instead of placeholders

**This requires manual admin panel action - cannot be automated from development environment.**
