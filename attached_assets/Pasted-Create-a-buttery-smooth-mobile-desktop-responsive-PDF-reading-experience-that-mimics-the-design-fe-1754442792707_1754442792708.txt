Create a buttery-smooth, mobile/desktop responsive PDF reading experience that mimics the design, feel, and fluidity of Apple Books — with full reading utilities, gesture responsiveness, and beautiful UI.

📍 REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITIES
📖 1. Polished Reading Experience
Fullscreen reader layout (/read/:bookId)

Smooth page flipping (support both swipe gestures and buttons)

Zoom in/out support (pinch or double tap on mobile)

Page number display (e.g. Page 5 / 200)

Scroll mode and Single page mode toggle (like Apple Books)

Responsive for:

Mobile portrait

Tablet landscape

Desktop fullscreen

🔖 2. Bookmarking System
Add/remove bookmark on any page

Sidebar for viewing all bookmarks

Bookmarks stored per user/book in DB:

POST /api/bookmarks → { userId, bookId, page }

GET /api/bookmarks/:bookId

Optional: Add a title or note per bookmark

Toggle bookmark icon on/off on current page

🔁 3. Reading Progress Tracking
Auto-save current page on scroll/flip

POST /api/progress → { userId, bookId, currentPage }

GET /api/progress/:bookId → resume to saved page

Works silently in background; no clicks needed
