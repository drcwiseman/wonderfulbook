🔍 1. ✅ FRONTEND AUDIT
✅ UI/UX & Responsiveness
 Does the homepage render correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop?

 Are book images scaling properly across devices?

 Are hover effects, buttons, and cards working smoothly?

 Are category shelves horizontally scrollable (Netflix-style)?

 Are transitions and animations clean (Framer Motion, etc.)?

✅ Navigation
 Can a user log in and log out cleanly?

 Can they browse by category?

🔍 2. ✅ BACKEND AUDIT (Express + PostgreSQL)
✅ API Health
 GET /api/books returns correct data grouped by category

 GET /api/book/:id returns detailed metadata

 GET /api/stream/:bookId securely streams PDF content only to authorized users

 GET /api/progress/:bookId and POST /api/progress work correctly

 GET /api/bookmarks/:bookId and POST /api/bookmarks are functional

✅ Authentication
 Is Replit Auth working?

 Are protected routes returning 401 when unauthenticated?

 Is JWT or Replit Auth properly enforced on book reading and subscription endpoints?

✅ Access Control
 Free users can access only 3 trial books

 Basic users can access 10 books per month

 Premium users have full access

 PDF access route checks the user’s tier correctly

🔍 3. ✅ PDF SECURITY AUDIT
 PDFs load only through the /api/stream/:bookId route

 Right-click, print, and download are all disabled on the reader

 There are no exposed links to raw PDF files in DevTools

 Access to PDFs without auth returns 401 or 403

🔍 4. ✅ SUBSCRIPTION FLOW (Stripe Integration)
✅ Stripe Checkout
 Can a user select and purchase a plan via Stripe?

 Stripe Checkout or Portal loads with correct plan info?

 After payment, user is redirected back and subscription tier updates in DB?

✅ Webhooks
 Stripe webhook is listening and working for:

checkout.session.completed

invoice.payment_succeeded

customer.subscription.updated

customer.subscription.deleted

 Subscription status and plan are updated in your users or subscriptions table?

🔍 5. ✅ DATABASE INTEGRITY (Drizzle + PostgreSQL)
 Are the following tables correctly structured and populated?

bash
Copy
Edit
users
books

 Are foreign key relationships working (userId → subscriptions, reading_progress, bookmarks)?

 No duplicate or orphaned rows?

 Tier information in books and users is accurate?

🔐 6. ✅ SECURITY CHECKLIST

 No hardcoded test values or tokens are in code

 Sensitive routes (e.g., /api/stream, /api/bookmarks) are not publicly accessible without auth

 Reader does not expose PDF file path in <iframe> or dev tools

 CORS settings are correctly configured for your frontend origin

🚦 7. ✅ PERFORMANCE & SEO
 Does the app load quickly on first load?

 Are images (book covers) optimized (webp, lazy loaded)?

 No console errors or red warnings in browser dev tools?

 Mobile Lighthouse score is at least 85+?

 Meta title, description, favicon, and manifest file are set?

🌐 8. ✅ DOMAIN & DEPLOYMENT (REPLIT)
 Is the project hosted via Replit’s public hosting?

 Is HTTPS working properly?

 Custom domain (if any) connected and SSL secured?

 .replit and replit.nix files are configured for production?

✅ FINAL LAUNCH CHECK
 Create a test user (trial), test plan restrictions

 Create a Stripe test user, subscribe to Basic + Premium

 Log in on mobile and test reading, navigation, bookmarking

 Review visual polish: padding, margins, font size, responsiveness
