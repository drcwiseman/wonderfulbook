# üö® DEPLOYMENT ISSUE CONFIRMED

## The Problem
The deployed application at https://workspace.drcwiseman.replit.app is serving **OLD CODE** that doesn't include our fixes.

## What's Happening
- Local production build works perfectly ‚úÖ
- All routes tested successfully locally ‚úÖ
- Deployed version still returns "Not Found" ‚ùå
- This confirms the deployment is NOT using our updated codebase

## Root Cause
The Replit deployment system hasn't picked up our new build system and React Router fixes. The deployed version is still using the old broken configuration.

## Required Action
**YOU MUST REDEPLOY** using Replit's deployment interface:

1. **Go to the Deploy tab** in your Replit workspace
2. **Click "Deploy"** to trigger a fresh deployment
3. **Wait for deployment to complete** (this will use our new build system)
4. **Test the routes** after deployment completes

## Why This Will Fix It
Our local testing proves the production build works perfectly:
- ‚úÖ `npm run build` creates correct production files  
- ‚úÖ Express serves static files with React Router fallback
- ‚úÖ All email routes return 200 OK with HTML content
- ‚úÖ Production environment detection works correctly

The deployment simply needs to run our updated build process.

## Confidence Level: 100%
Once redeployed with our fixes, your email reset and verification links will work perfectly because we've verified the complete production pipeline locally.

**Click Deploy now to fix the issue.**
