# Production Health Check Critical Fix

## Issue Identified
The production health monitoring system was showing **FAIL** status due to a critical endpoint mismatch in the server health check.

## Root Cause
- Health check function was calling `http://localhost:${port}/api/health/ping` 
- But the actual endpoint is `/ping` (not `/api/health/ping`)
- This caused 404 errors, marking server health as FAIL
- Since any FAIL status marks the overall system as FAIL, entire health monitoring showed critical failure

## Production Error Details
From production health check API response:
```json
{
  "name": "server",
  "status": "FAIL", 
  "message": "Server check failed: Request failed with status code 404"
}
```

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed Health Check Endpoint**: Changed `server/health/checks.ts` line 162:
   - From: `http://localhost:${port}/api/health/ping`
   - To: `http://localhost:${port}/ping`

2. **Verified Endpoints**:
   - ✅ `/ping` - Available and responds with "pong"
   - ✅ `/health` - Available for basic health checks  
   - ✅ `/healthz` - Available for readiness checks

3. **Rebuilt Production**: Complete production build with fixed health checks

## Expected Result
- Server health checks will now pass consistently
- Overall system health status will show **OK** instead of **FAIL**
- Production health monitoring will accurately reflect system state

## Verification
- Development `/ping`: ✅ Working
- Production `/ping`: ✅ Working (mywonderfulbooks.com)
- All other health checks (database, SMTP, Stripe, storage, external API) already passing

## Impact
This fixes the critical false-positive health check failure that was showing system-wide issues when the platform was actually functioning properly.
