# SIMPLE STEPS TO FIX THE PDF PROBLEM

## What You Need to Do:

### Step 1: Open Database
1. Look at the left sidebar in Replit
2. Click the **Database** icon (looks like a cylinder/database)
3. Make sure it says "Production" at the top

### Step 2: Run This SQL
1. Click on the **"Query"** or **"SQL"** tab
2. Copy ALL the text from the file `CRITICAL_PDF_FIX.sql`
3. Paste it in the query box
4. Click the **"Run"** or **"Execute"** button

### That's it! The PDFs will be fixed immediately.

## Alternative: If Database Pane Doesn't Work

Try this in the Replit Shell:
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL < CRITICAL_PDF_FIX.sql
```

## Why I Can't Do It For You:
- I don't have access to your production database
- Only you can modify production data for security reasons
- The database credentials are private to your account

## What Will Happen:
Once you run the SQL commands:
- All 30 books will immediately have the correct PDFs
- Users can read the right content for each book
- No deployment needed - it's instant
