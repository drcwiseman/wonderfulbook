# PRODUCTION IMAGE RESTORATION - COMPLETE âœ…

## Issue Resolved
Book cover images were showing placeholder "Book Cover" images instead of actual book covers on mywonderfulbooks.com production site.

## Root Cause Identified
1. **Missing Image Files**: Production API was returning JPG file URLs that don't exist (all return HTTP 404)
2. **Database Out of Sync**: Database contained references to missing JPG files from recent uploads
3. **Correct PNG Files Available**: Original PNG files from early August are still accessible in production

## Solution Applied

### Database Updates Completed âœ…
```sql
-- Updated all main book covers to use confirmed working PNG files
UPDATE books SET cover_image_url = '/uploads/1754453446477-kgg86a.png' WHERE title LIKE '%Covenant%';
UPDATE books SET cover_image_url = '/uploads/1754453929800-msice.png' WHERE title LIKE '%Multiply%';  
UPDATE books SET cover_image_url = '/uploads/1754454150690-j5ycd2.png' WHERE title LIKE '%Dismantle%';
UPDATE books SET cover_image_url = '/uploads/1754454759109-pm9ru.png' WHERE title LIKE '%Home Altar%';
UPDATE books SET cover_image_url = '/uploads/1754454964404-hyn8.png' WHERE title LIKE '%Planted to Flourish%';
```

### Image Accessibility Confirmed âœ…
All restored images verified working in production:
- âœ… `/uploads/1754453446477-kgg86a.png` - HTTP 200 (Covenant Wealth)
- âœ… `/uploads/1754453929800-msice.png` - HTTP 200 (Multiply the Vision)  
- âœ… `/uploads/1754454150690-j5ycd2.png` - HTTP 200 (30 Days to Dismantle)
- âœ… `/uploads/1754454759109-pm9ru.png` - HTTP 200 (Home Altar)
- âœ… `/uploads/1754454964404-hyn8.png` - HTTP 200 (Planted to Flourish)

### API Response Fixed âœ…
The production `/api/books` endpoint now returns correct image URLs that actually exist and are accessible.

## Books Restored
The following featured books now display their actual covers instead of placeholders:

1. **"Covenant Wealth: Unlocking God's Divine Economy through Tithes, Offerings & First Fruits"**
   - Cover: `/uploads/1754453446477-kgg86a.png` âœ…

2. **"Multiply the Vision: A Practical Guide to Equipping Leaders Who Make Disciples"**
   - Cover: `/uploads/1754453929800-msice.png` âœ…

## Technical Details
- **Frontend**: BookCoverImage component properly handles fallbacks
- **API**: Property mapping for coverImageUrl working correctly
- **Static Serving**: Production uploads directory serving with proper CORS headers
- **Database**: All main book entries updated with working image URLs

## Result
The production website at mywonderfulbooks.com now displays the original book cover images instead of "Book Cover" placeholders. The Featured Books section and bookstore pages show the correct cover artwork for all restored titles.
