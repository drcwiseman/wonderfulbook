# Production Data Migration Guide

## Overview
You have 33 books in development that can be migrated to production. This guide shows you how to do it.

## Current Development Books (33 total)
All books by Dr Climate Wiseman, including:
- 30 Days to Overcome Procrastination
- 30 Days To Overcome Bitterness
- 30 Days To Overcome The Spirit Of Depression
- 30 Days To Overcome Family Conflicts
- 30 Days To Overcome The Spirit Of Captivity

## Migration Options

### Option 1: Deploy and Database Sync (Recommended)
1. **Deploy your application** - This will push all code and files
2. **The deployment will include:**
   - All 76 images in `/uploads/`
   - All 42 PDFs in `/uploads/pdfs/`
   - Your current database schema

3. **After deployment, the database needs manual sync:**
   - Go to Database pane in Replit
   - Export development database
   - Import to production database

### Option 2: Manual Upload via Admin Panel
1. Go to https://mywonderfulbooks.com/admin
2. Use "Upload New Book" for each book
3. Upload the PDF and cover image files
4. Fill in the book details

### Option 3: Automated Migration Script
I can create a script that will:
- Export all book data from development
- Prepare it for production import
- Include all file references

## Files Ready for Migration
- **Images**: 76 total (all book covers)
- **PDFs**: 42 total (all book files)
- **Database records**: 33 books

## Important Notes
- Production already has different books uploaded
- Migration will ADD your development books, not replace
- All file paths are already compatible
- PDF system will work immediately after migration

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy first** to push all files
2. **Then migrate database** using one of the options above
3. All books will be available in production
