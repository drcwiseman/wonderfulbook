# Production Data Migration Guide

## Current Status
- **Development Database**: 32 books with complete metadata and PDF files
- **PDF Files**: Stored in `/uploads/pdfs/` directory 
- **Cover Images**: Stored with proper fallback system
- **Issue**: Development data won't automatically transfer to production deployment

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Pre-Production Book Upload (Recommended)
Since you're actively uploading books, continue this process after deployment:

1. **Deploy the application first** (empty database is fine)
2. **Access production admin panel** at `https://mywonderfulbooks.com/admin`
3. **Re-upload your book collection** using the admin interface
4. **Benefits**: 
   - Fresh, clean production database
   - No data migration complexity
   - All books properly indexed for production

### Option 2: Database Export/Import
If you want to preserve current data:

1. **Export current books**:
```sql
COPY (SELECT * FROM books) TO '/tmp/books_export.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
```

2. **Export categories**:
```sql
COPY (SELECT * FROM categories) TO '/tmp/categories_export.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
```

3. **After deployment, import to production database**

### Option 3: Automated Book Seeding
Create a production seed script for common books.

## Current Book Collection (32 Books)
Your current library includes:
- 30 Days series by Dr Climate Wiseman
- Personal development titles
- Spiritual growth books  
- Mindset and success books

## Recommendation
**Go with Option 1** - Continue uploading books post-deployment:

✅ **Advantages:**
- Cleanest approach for production
- Ensures all production optimizations apply
- No risk of data corruption
- Easy to manage going forward

## Post-Deployment Steps
1. Deploy application using Replit Deploy button
2. Verify domain configuration (mywonderfulbooks.com)
3. Access admin panel and begin uploading your book collection
4. Test all features with fresh production data
5. Set up monitoring and backups

## Files That Transfer in Deployment
✅ **Included in deployment**:
- All code and application files
- Static assets and configurations
- PDF files in `/uploads/` directory (if using object storage)

❌ **Not included**:
- Database records (books, users, etc.)
- Session data
- Logs and temporary files

Your book files are preserved, just the database records need recreation.
