# Deployment Issue Analysis

## Current Status
- ✅ Build Process: Working (1.6MB frontend, 111KB backend)
- ✅ All Components Present: 16 pages, 17 main components
- ✅ API Endpoints: Responding correctly
- ✅ Database: Connected and working
- ✅ Authentication: Local auth system functional

## Potential Issues in Deployment

### 1. Environment Variables
- DATABASE_URL (must be production database)
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY / VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
- SESSION_SECRET
- Environment-specific configs

### 2. Static Assets 
- Book cover images
- PDF files
- Icon/logo files
- Favicon and meta images

### 3. Routing Issues
- Client-side routing vs server routing
- 404 handling for SPA routes
- API path conflicts

### 4. Production vs Development Differences
- Error boundaries
- HTTPS vs HTTP
- Cross-origin issues
- Cache settings

### 5. Missing Features That Could Appear "Missing"
- Books not loading (API issues)
- Authentication not persisting
- PDF reader not working
- Search functionality broken
- Mobile responsiveness issues

## Action Plan
1. Fix any remaining TypeScript errors
2. Verify all critical pages render correctly
3. Test core user flows
4. Ensure production-ready error handling
5. Document known limitations
