# CRITICAL PRODUCTION DATABASE FIX REQUIRED

## The Problem
The production database has 30+ books with PDF URLs pointing to files that don't exist (175504xxx series). These PDFs were uploaded directly to production but never synced to development, causing "PDF loading failed" errors.

## The Solution
We need to update the production database to point these books to the CORRECT existing PDF files that match their content.

## How to Fix This Permanently

### Option 1: Direct Database Update (RECOMMENDED)
1. Access your production database directly through Replit's database pane
2. Run the SQL commands in `CRITICAL_PDF_FIX.sql` to update all mismatched PDFs
3. This will immediately fix all books to load their correct PDFs

### Option 2: Using the Production Admin Panel
1. Log into https://mywonderfulbooks.com/admin
2. For each book with a 175504xxx image:
   - Click Edit
   - Update the PDF URL to the correct file from this mapping:

### Option 3: Re-upload the PDFs
1. In the production admin panel
2. Re-upload the correct PDF file for each book
3. This will generate new PDF URLs that actually exist

## Why This Happened
When books were uploaded in production with new PDFs, those PDF files only exist on the production server. The development environment doesn't have access to them, so the fallback system can't work properly.

## Permanent Prevention
Going forward, always ensure that:
1. Books uploaded in production have their PDFs synced to development
2. Or use PDFs that already exist in both environments
3. Or re-upload PDFs through the admin panel to ensure they exist

## Immediate Action Required
The production database needs to be updated NOW to fix the PDF mismatches. Use Option 1 (SQL update) for the fastest fix.
